<html><body><p>This may be the "year of efficiency" for <strong>Meta Platforms</strong> (<strong>META</strong>) according to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, but it wasn't the company's cost-cutting or restructuring actions that really stood out in its better-than-expected 2Q23 earnings report. Rather, the reacceleration of META's growth is capturing the most attention today as revenue increased by 11% yr/yr -- the company's strongest growth since 4Q21. Better yet, META's Q3 revenue guidance of $32.0-$34.50 bln, which easily surpassed estimates, indicates that growth will sharply accelerate again to about 20% based on the midpoint of the range.<br><br>META's fortunes have changed dramatically following a rough FY22 that saw its revenue decrease on a yr/yr basis in each of the last three quarters of the year. The turnaround is reflected in the stock's incredible 170%+ year-to-date gain.</p><ul><li>Lowering costs to better align the company with its declining revenue base has been part of the turnaround equation. After spending freely in 2021 and 2022 to support the build out of the metaverse to the dismay of investors, Mr. Zuckerberg finally relented following META's dismal 3Q22 earnings report. <ul><li>In addition to reining in metaverse-related spending, META slashed about 20,000 jobs over the past several months.</li></ul></li><li>Simultaneously, META increasingly leaned on its expanding AI capabilities to mitigate the impact of <strong>Apple's</strong> (<strong>AAPL</strong>) iOS privacy changes. Through the use of AI technology, META can provide improved ad targeting, making its platform more appealing to marketers. On that note, ad impressions across META's family of apps jumped by 34% yr/yr.&nbsp;</li><li>The rising competitive threat from TikTok, which was another major storyline in 2022, is also fizzling out a bit. This is partly due to concerns regarding TikTok's ties to China through its parent company ByteDance. <ul><li>With TikTok under scrutiny from the&nbsp;Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), some advertisers are likely steering clear of the uncertainty surrounding the short-format video platform. </li></ul></li><li>However, META also deserves credit for growing and improving the monetization of its TikTok-like Reels app. During the earnings call, META said that it continues to make good progress on Reels monetization with AI delivering automated ad products.</li></ul><p>One potential red flag, though, is that META lifted its FY23 expense guidance higher to $88-$91 bln from $86-$90 bln, while also warning that it anticipates expenses growing in 2024 as it invests in AI and the metaverse. </p><ul><li>Last year, this news likely would have sent shares spiraling lower, but since META's growth is now on the upswing, investors are taking it in stride. </li><li>Still, it's somewhat unsettling that META expects losses in the Reality Labs segment to increase meaningfully next year as it pours money into its unprofitable virtual reality products.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The main takeaway is that META has reemerged as a compelling growth story with a few significant catalysts currently playing out including an AI-powered recovery in its ad business, improving monetization for Reels, and the recent launch of Threads. While the company currently has the wind at its back, one concern is that Mr. Zuckerberg will use the improving growth as a green light to ramp up spending on the metaverse -- a tactic that drove META shares to multi-year lows last October.</p><BR><BR>Copyright (C) 2023 Briefing.com</body></html>
