IB Financial Analyst with GPT-4, Llama Index, and Streamlit

Tired of reading through news articles when ChatGPT can do it for you?

Using Interactive Brokers, we use ETL processes with LLama Index and Lang Chain to parse through up-to-date articles on companies.

Using this demo, you can use ChatGPT to read through all the data and summarize the most essential key points about a particular company or compare between two tickers.

You can only run this project with GPT-4 currently, will implement a demo using Stability API.
